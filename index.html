        <h3>About The Winner Team 2022</h3>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i>Argentina<i class="fas fa-trophy"></i></h4>
        <p>
            The Argentina World Cup 2022 squad has managed to reach the final in Qatar, beating the Netherlands on penalties in the quarter-finals before defeating Croatia 3-0 in the semis.

The Albiceleste were one of the hot favourites to win the Qatar World Cup 2022 coming into the tournament, not least because the 2021 Copa America winners boast Lionel Messi in their team. Messi has scored five crucial goals for Argentina, his inspired form proving why they were so heavily fancied.  

Of course, it hasn't been all plain sailing for Argentina at this World Cup, losing their opening game 2-1 to Saudi Arabia in one of the biggest shocks in the tournament's history. The South Americans managed to dust themselves off, though, recovering in their next two group games to beat both Mexico and Poland 2-0.

            Julian Alvarez has usurped Lautaro Martinez as the team's starting striker, the Manchester City man repaying his manager's faith with four goals. Alexis Mac Allister and Enzo Fernandez have both fought their way into Argentina's starting line-up, too, ousting Angel Di Maria and Leandro Parades due to the pair's slow start against Saudi Arabia. 

It is Lionel Scaloni's ability to switch things mid-game if the original plan isn't working which could prove crucial against France - that, and Lionel Messi's brilliance, of course. Tactically, Scaloni doesn’t cling to any football dogma. He’ll switch from 4-2-3-1 to a 5-4-1 in the same game, a trait that has served Argentina well so far in the tournament (Saudi Arabia aside).

Having scratched that 28-year trophy itch at the 2021 Copa America, Argentina now believe it’s time to rip the scab off the ghosts of 1986 and win a World Cup.

        <h3>Who is Argentina's manager for World Cup 2022?</h3>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i>Lionel Scaloni's<i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i></h4>
        <p>
            Lionel Scaloni has proved to be fundamental. Going from caretaker to surprise manager, the former Deportivo La Coruna wing-back, who had a forgettable loan spell at West Ham in 2006, was targeted because of his lack of experience, yet he started a silent renovation. He has shaped a stable team that won its first major title since 1993.

        <h3>Who is Argentina's best player 2022?</h3>
        <h4><i class="fas fa-medal"></i>Messi<i class="fas fa-medal"></i></h4>
        <p>
            In his fifth (and last?) World Cup attempt, Lionel Messi is enjoying his time as never before, his critics vanishing since the Copa America victory. Argentines dreamed of winning because of Messi, but now they dream of winning for Messi. Whatever the position, the Flea always plays 90 minutes – Scaloni just wants to keep him happy.
